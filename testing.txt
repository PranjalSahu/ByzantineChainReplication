Run the code using the following command:

python3 -m da -n ClientNode src/main.da ./config/config1.txt
python3 -m da -n OlympusNode src/main.da ./config/config1.txt

Log file is created inside the logs folder with the same as test_case_name
A test file with extention .test is also created if the code reaches the testing phase
